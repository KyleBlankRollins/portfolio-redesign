 non-exclusive license:

 a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

 b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
    sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
</code></pre> <p>2.2. Effective Date</p> <pre><code> The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.
</code></pre> <p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p> <pre><code> The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:

 a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

 b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

 c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
</code></pre> <p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p> <pre><code> No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
</code></pre> <p>2.5. Representation</p> <pre><code> Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
 grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
</code></pre> <p>2.6. Fair Use</p> <pre><code> This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
</code></pre> <p>2.7. Conditions</p> <pre><code> Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
 Section 2.1.
</code></pre> <ol start="3"><li>Responsibilities</li></ol> <p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p> <pre><code> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
</code></pre> <p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p> <pre><code> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

 a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
    as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
    Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
    reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
    of distribution to the recipient; and

 b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
    recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
</code></pre> <p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p> <pre><code> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
</code></pre> <p>3.4. Notices</p> <pre><code> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
 limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
 Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
 extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
</code></pre> <p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p> <pre><code> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
</code></pre> <ol start="4"><li><p>Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</p> <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.</p></li> <li><p>Termination</p></li></ol> <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
of the notice.</p> <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p> <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
termination shall survive termination.</p> <ol start="6"><li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty</p> <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot; basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
this License except under this disclaimer.</p></li> <li><p>Limitation of Liability</p> <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
not apply to You.</p></li> <li><p>Litigation</p> <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
counter-claims.</p></li> <li><p>Miscellaneous</p> <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p></li> <li><p>Versions of the License</p></li></ol> <p>10.1. New Versions</p> <pre><code>  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.
</code></pre> <p>10.2. Effect of New Versions</p> <pre><code>  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
  of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
  or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
  steward.
</code></pre> <p>10.3. Modified Versions</p> <pre><code>  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
  modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
  any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
  such modified license differs from this License).
</code></pre> <p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
attached.</p> <p>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice</p> <pre><code>  This Source Code Form is subject to the
