Welcome to KyleBlankRollins.com â€” I'm __Kyle__. 

I'm a technical writer with a diverse background. I currently document software in the healthcare industry for [3M Health Information Systems](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/health-information-systems-us/).

Outside of work, I'm a father, hobbyist web developer, and serial Write the Docs Meetup organizer.

## About this site
I built this site to satisfy my curiosity about a couple of things: VuePress and Tailwind CSS.

I've re-built my portfolio site half a dozen times over the course of my web development experience. When I find something particularly interesting, I look for excuses to experiment. That usually results in things like this website's current iteration.

### Tech stack
This is an entirely front-end website. I used VuePress to handle the site's layout and logic. Using single-file .vue components within markdown files is very convenient.

Taking convenience a step further, Tailwind CSS allowed me to effectively use in-line CSS, further streamling those single-file .vue components.

The source is stored in a GitHub repo. Netlify deploys from that repo and handles hosting.
